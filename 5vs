It seems there might be a bit of confusion in your question. The term "5vs" doesn't have a standard meaning, and I'm not aware of any widely recognized list of 17 items related to it. However, if you are referring to the concept of the "V's" in data management, there are generally five commonly used ones, known as the "Five Vs of Big Data." They are:

Volume: Refers to the vast amount of data generated or collected.
Velocity: Describes the speed at which data is generated, processed, and analyzed.
Variety: Represents the different types of data, including structured, semi-structured, and unstructured data.
Veracity: Refers to the reliability and accuracy of the data.
Value: Focuses on extracting meaningful insights and value from the data.
